You can run the game by opening the .exe file.

The object of the game is to find all 3 of the keys. You begin the game with the ability to use WASD to move, double jump, and fall through platforms
and you can attack at a short distance using spacebar.
Once you find the red key you will gain fire power, which increases your attack range and allows you to hold space to charge your attack and release
a powerful ranged fireball.
